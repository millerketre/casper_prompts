               Prompt: You’re working as a XX in XX team. It’s time to set up your performance objectives for the year
               ahead
               at Casper.
               Task: rewrite the below employee objectives to be in line with the SHARP principles. SHARP principles
               are:
               <br>
               • Specific, clearly stating what someone will deliver and by when, and agreed by you and your
               manager.<br>
               • Stretching but achievable chunky pieces of work aligned to the team’s and wider business priorities and
               Casper’s strategic pillars.<br>
               • In service of clients’ best interests and not in conflict with these.<br>
               • Three is the optimum number<br>
               • Kept relevant – we need to continually and proactively monitor how we’re doing against our objectives
               and
               keep them updated, ideally monthly and at least quarterly.<br>
               • If you are in a broking or production role, we would expect you to have stretching objectives linked to
               revenue, margin and client retention, for example.<br>
               • If you work in management services, we expect you to have objectives related to specific pieces of work
               you
               are delivering, for example, smarter or data driven ways of working you are implementing or projects you
               are
               contributing to.

               and
               each other. When we say we will do something, our highly skilled and resourceful team does everything in
